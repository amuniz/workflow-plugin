    Milestone Ordinal.
</p>
<p>
    It is a possitive number which serves two purposes:
    <ol>
      <li>Unambiguously identify the milestone in the scope of the script</li>
      <li>Determine the ordering of the milestone respect other milestones in the script</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    As this step forces builds to pass through it in-order it requires an ordering field.
    The value assigned to this field needs to comply with the following: <strong>whichever two consecutive 
    milestones their ordinals must be two consecutive natural numbers</strong>.
