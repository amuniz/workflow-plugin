    <p>By default, Pipeline builds can run concurrently.</p>
    <p>
        The milestone step forces all builds to go through in order, so an older build will never be allowed to
        go into the milestone (it is aborted) if a newer one already passed it.
    </p>
    <p>
        It also lets you mark certain sections of a build as being constrained by limited concurrency. Newer builds are 
        always given priority when entering such a throttled milestone; older waiting builds will simply exit early if 
        they are preÃ«mpted.
